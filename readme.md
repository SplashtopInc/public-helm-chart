## Create a helm chart from scratch (or copy your own)
As a pre-requisite of this stage, you need to have the Helm CLI installed and initialized. Please find here the instructions in case you havenâ€™t install Helm client yet.

use the directory ./helm-chart-sources/ for the sources of our charts. You might want to copy into ./helm-chart-sources/ your charts instead:

```
mkdir ./helm-chart-sources && cd ./helm-chart-sources/

helm create helm-chart-sources/helm-chart-test
```

## Create the Helm chart package
modify the chart.yaml

ensure the chart version and app version

## Lint the chart

```
helm lint helm-chart-sources/*
```


## Create the Helm chart package
```
helm package helm-chart-sources/*
```

## Create the Helm chart repository index

According to [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/#create-a-chart-repository)

A chart repository is an HTTP server that houses an index.yaml file and optionally some packaged charts. When you're ready to share your charts, the preferred way to do so is by uploading them to a chart repository.

```
helm repo index --url https://splashtopinc.github.io/public-helm-chart/ .
```
![helm index](./readme-img/helm-index.png)

## Push the git repository on GitHub

```
git add . && git commit -m "argocd chart version update" && git push origin master
```

## Configure the repository as a Github pages site
